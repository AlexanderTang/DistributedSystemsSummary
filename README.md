# Distributed Systems Summary

Contains exam answers of the course **Distributed Systems** at KU Leuven. This document was created in 2015. The questions form a compilation of recurring exam questions in previous years and proved to be very accurate for my own exam in januari 2016. I do not guarantee this will continue to be the case in the future, so use this document at your own discretion.

The answers are based off the chapters in the book **Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design, Fifth Edition** and feedback from the projects. It is based on my own understanding and interpretation of the material, which means it's possible mistakes are present. Feel free to suggest modifications to mistakes you find.
